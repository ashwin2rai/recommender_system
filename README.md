# Recommender System

This project starts with a standardized example of a recommender system and then expands on it by introducing various metrics and a matrix factorization based recommendation algorithm and compares the different recommendation algorithms. Please note, the pearson similarity based recommendation algorithm comes from a standard example on the web and was not written by the author.
